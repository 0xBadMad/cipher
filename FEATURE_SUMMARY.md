- **Dual Collection Manager**: Enhanced with event emission capabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Vector operations tracked through event system

#### 5. **CLI Tools Integration** (`src/core/events/cli-tools.ts`)
- Command-line event monitoring
- Real-time event streaming
- Event filtering and search
- Performance analysis tools

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **340+ test cases** across all event system components
- **Integration tests** for multi-tier event flow
- **Performance tests** for high-load scenarios
- **Service event bus tests** with 200+ assertions
- **Session event bus tests** with 285+ test cases
- **Event manager tests** covering all functionality
