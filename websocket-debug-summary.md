# WebSocket Event Routing Debug Summary

## Issue
WebSocket events are being emitted and broadcast by the server but not reaching the UI client.

## Current State Analysis

### Event Flow
1. **Client sends message** → WebSocket message-router.ts
2. **Message Router** creates/binds session → connection-manager.ts
3. **Agent processes** → MemAgent emits events via EventManager
4. **Event Subscriber** listens to events → event-subscriber.ts
5. **Connection Manager** broadcasts to session connections

### Debug Findings
- ✅ Events ARE being emitted by LLM services (confirmed in logs)
- ✅ Events ARE being broadcast to sessions (logs show broadcast attempts)
- ❌ Events NOT reaching client WebSocket connections

### Key Areas to Investigate

#### 1. Session Binding Issue
- Check if sessionId from message router matches sessionId from event emission
- Verify that connection is properly bound to session before agent.run()

#### 2. Event Subscriber Issue
- Check if event subscriber is properly subscribed to the session
- Verify that subscribeToSession() is called when connection is bound

#### 3. Connection Manager Issue
- Check if broadcastToSession() finds the correct connections
- Verify that connections are in OPEN state when broadcast occurs

### Debug Output Added
- Added DEBUG prefix to all debug logs for easier filtering
- Added session binding verification logs
- Added connection state tracking logs
- Added event subscription tracking logs

### Next Steps
1. Run a test message and check logs for:
   - Session ID consistency
   - Connection binding success
   - Event subscription success
   - Broadcast target verification
