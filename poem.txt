In the hush of dawn's first light,
Silent whispers wake the sky,
Threads of gold on edges bright,
Promise woven, time slips by.

Petals open, greet the day,
Dreams once tethered now take flight,
Hope ignites in gentle sway,
Hearts drawn to morning's light.

Every breath a soft refrain,
Songs of longing, songs of grace,
In each moment, joy remains,
Life reborn in day's embrace.
