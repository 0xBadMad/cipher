### MCP Server Breakdown

#### File System Server
```yaml
filesystem:
  type: stdio
  command: npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
  connectionMode: strict  # Critical for file operations
```
**Capabilities**: Secure file read/write operations with configurable access controls


#### Firecrawl Server
```yaml
firecrawl:
  type: stdio
  command: npx -y firecrawl-mcp
  connectionMode: lenient  # Fallback option
```
**Capabilities**: Advanced web scraping, documentation research, technology lookup

#### SQLite Server
```yaml
# Note: @modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite is not available on npm
# For SQLite functionality, use Python-based alternatives:
# uvx mcp-server-git (provides both git and sqlite capabilities)
```
**Note**: SQLite MCP server is not available via npm. Consider using filesystem operations or Python-based alternatives for database needs.

## Usage Examples

### Development Workflow Examples

```bash
cipher> Please review the authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.js and suggest improvements for security and performance.
```

The assistant will:
- Read and analyze the file using filesystem tools
- Research current security best practices via Firecrawl
- Provide detailed recommendations with code examples
- Remember your security preferences for future reviews

#### 2. **Code Architecture Analysis**
```bash
cipher> Analyze my current authentication system and suggest improvements for security and maintainability.
```

The assistant will:
- Read and analyze your authentication-related files
- Research current security best practices
- Provide detailed recommendations with implementation steps

#### 3. **Research-Driven Development**
```bash
cipher> I need to implement real-time notifications. Research the latest WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events approaches and recommend the best solution for a React app.
```

The assistant will:
- Use Firecrawl to research current documentation and articles
- Analyze your existing codebase to understand the architecture
- Provide a detailed comparison with implementation examples
- Store the research in memory for future reference

#### 4. **Database-Driven Features**
```bash
cipher> Design a database schema for a blog system and create the initial SQLite tables with sample data.
```

The assistant will:
- Design an appropriate database schema
- Use SQLite tools to create tables and relationships
- Insert meaningful sample data for testing
- Document the schema decisions for future reference

### Advanced Usage Patterns

#### Multi-File Code Analysis
```bash
cipher> Analyze my entire authentication system across multiple files and suggest a comprehensive refactoring plan.
```

### Performance Tuning

#### For Large Codebases
```yaml
# Increase timeout for file operations
filesystem:
  timeout: 60000  # 1 minute for large projects
```

#### For Network-Heavy Tasks
```yaml
# Adjust Firecrawl retry settings
firecrawl:
  env:
    FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS: '5'
    FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY: '15000'
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom File System Paths
```yaml
filesystem:
  args:
    - -y
    - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'
    - /path/to/your/workspace  # Restrict to specific directory
```

### Additional MCP Servers

Add more development tools as needed:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  # Add Docker integration
  docker:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "mcp-server-docker"]
    connectionMode: lenient
  
  # Add PostgreSQL for larger projects
  postgres:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"]
    env:
      POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING: $DATABASE_URL
    connectionMode: lenient
```

### Custom System Prompt

Modify the `systemPrompt` section to match your specific development style:

```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a Senior [Your Language] Developer specializing in:
  - [Your specific tech stack]
  - [Your preferred frameworks]
  - [Your coding standards]
  
  Always follow these team conventions:
  - [Your team's coding standards]
  - [Your preferred testing approach]
  - [Your architecture patterns]
```

## Integration with IDEs

### VS Code Integration
The assistant can be integrated with VS Code through MCP server mode:

```bash

cipher --mode mcp --agent ./cipher.yml

# Configure in VS Code settings
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "cipher-coding": {
      "command": "cipher",
      "args": ["--mode", "mcp", "--agent", "./cipher.yml"]
    }
  }
}
```

### API Integration
Use API mode for custom integrations:

```bash
# Start API server
cipher --mode api --agent ./cipher.yml --port 3000

# Use in your scripts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/message/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Analyze this code for security issues"}'
```
