- Verify API key permissions

### Performance Tuning

#### For Large Codebases
```yaml
# Increase timeout for file operations
filesystem:
  timeout: 60000  # 1 minute for large projects
```

#### For Network-Heavy Tasks
```yaml
# Adjust Firecrawl retry settings
firecrawl:
  env:
    FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS: '5'
    FIRECRAWL_RETRY_MAX_DELAY: '15000'
```

## Advanced Customization

### Custom File System Paths
```yaml
filesystem:
  args:
    - -y
    - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'
    - /path/to/your/workspace  # Restrict to specific directory
```

### Additional MCP Servers

Add more development tools as needed:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  # Add Docker integration
  docker:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "mcp-server-docker"]
    connectionMode: lenient
  
  # Add PostgreSQL for larger projects
  postgres:
    type: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres"]
    env:
      POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING: $DATABASE_URL
    connectionMode: lenient
```

### Custom System Prompt

Modify the `systemPrompt` section to match your specific development style:

```yaml
systemPrompt: |
  You are a Senior [Your Language] Developer specializing in:
  - [Your specific tech stack]
  - [Your preferred frameworks]
  - [Your coding standards]
  
  Always follow these team conventions:
  - [Your team's coding standards]
  - [Your preferred testing approach]

{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "cipher-coding": {
      "command": "cipher",
      "args": ["--mode", "mcp", "--agent", "./cipher.yml"]
    }
  }
}
```

### API Integration
Use API mode for custom integrations:

```bash
# Start API server
cipher --mode api --agent ./cipher.yml --port 3000

# Use in your scripts
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/message/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Analyze this code for security issues"}'
```
