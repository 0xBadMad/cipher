# Known Bugs and Issues - Persistent Sessions

## Overview

This document tracks all known bugs and issues encountered during the development and testing of the persistent sessions feature. **All issues listed below remain unfixed at the time of this documentation.**

## Critical Issues

### 1. Session Deletion Failures

**Status**: ❌ **UNFIXED**

**Description**: Session deletion operations consistently fail with "Failed to delete session" errors.

**Error Logs**:
```
12:45:08 ERROR: Failed to delete session
12:45:10 ERROR: Failed to delete session
12:45:10 ERROR: Failed to delete session
```

**Impact**: 
- Users cannot delete unwanted sessions
- Session list becomes cluttered over time
- Potential storage bloat from unused sessions

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Likely related to storage manager connection issues
- Possible race conditions during deletion
- Session manager may not properly handle deletion requests

**Attempted Fixes**:
- Added error handling in session deletion API

### 2. "[object Object]" Error Display

**Status**: ❌ **UNFIXED**

**Description**: Error messages display as "[object Object]" instead of proper error text in the UI.

**UI Manifestation**:
```
Error
[object Object]
```

**Impact**:
- Users see unhelpful error messages
- Difficult to debug actual issues
- Poor user experience

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Error objects being passed to UI instead of string messages
