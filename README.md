# Overview

*`cipher`* is a simple, composable framework to build memory for agents using [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

**Design Principal**:
`cipher` bring the fundamental and best practices for building agent's memory:

1. It handles the complexity of MCP server connection's lifecycle so you don't have to
2. It implements the best practices for layered memories which helps your agents learning the data you already have. the memory layers improves with every run - rquiring zero changes in your agent's implementation and zero human guidance.
3. The memory aligns closely with the congnitive structure of the human minds, offering robust and realtime tuning.
4. It implements the reflections mechanism; this is not just the way to diagnose the issues with your agent, they're valuable data for agent can learn from.

Altogether, `cipher` is the simplest and easiest way to build memory for agents using MCP that helps your agents to remember and learn from the previous actions.

Much like MCP. this project is in early development.
